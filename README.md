## Description
This is a Conway's Game of Life clone using python and pygame. The simulation wraps the board around on the edges, so it is not infinite, but this may be changed in future versions. The idea behind the game of life is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

# How to Play
The simulation starts in a paused state, as denoted by the pause symbol in the top left corner. In this state, the
user can click on any cells to toggle their state. The user can then press the space bar, which will start the simulation. The simulation can be paused and unpaused at any time.
